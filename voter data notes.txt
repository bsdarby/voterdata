Voter Data
from Santa Clara County Registrar of Voters

1. Some fields appear to have commas, must use tabs or something else as separator.
2. I saved as CSV, with ~ as separator
3. No double-quotes around number/data fields
4. Changed number/date fields in database structure.
		Convert dates to 2001-05-08 format
5. Import with "Replace table data with file" set.
6. Can skip the column header row, don't have to delete it.
